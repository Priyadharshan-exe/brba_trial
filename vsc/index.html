            <p>A graduate of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), Walter co-founded the company Gray Matter Technologies with his then-girlfriend Gretchen Schwartz and his close friend Elliott Schwartz.He left Gray Matter abruptly, selling his shares for $5,000.[1][2] Soon afterward, the company made a fortune, much of it from his research. Walt subsequently moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, where he became a high school chemistry teacher. Breaking Bad begins on Walt's 50th birthday, when he is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer. After this discovery, he resorts to manufacturing and selling methamphetamines with his former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to ensure his family's financial security after his death.<hr> He is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade, becoming more and more ruthless as the series progresses, and later adopts the alias "Heisenberg", which becomes recognizable as the kingpin figure in the local drug trade. Series creator Vince Gilligan has described his goal with Walter White as "turning Mr. Chips into Scarface" and deliberately made the character less sympathetic over the course of the series. Walt's evolution from a mild-mannered school teacher and family man into a dangerous drug lord and murderer is the show's central focus.

            Although AMC officials initially hesitated to cast Cranston due to his previous comedic role on Malcolm in the Middle, Gilligan cast him based on the actor's past performance in the X-Files episode "Drive", which Gilligan wrote. Cranston contributed greatly to the creation of his character, including Walt's backstory, personality, and physical appearance.</h4>

                Jesse Bruce Pinkman is a fictional character in the television series Breaking Bad, played by Aaron Paul. He is a crystal meth cook and dealer, and works with his former high school chemistry teacher, Walter White (Bryan Cranston) in a meth operation. Jesse is the only character besides Walt to appear in every episode of the show. Paul reprised the role for the 2019 spin-off film El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, a sequel to the series set after the events of the show's series finale.<hr>
                Despite plans to kill off the character at the end of the first season, Paul's performance convinced showrunner and head writer Vince Gilligan to keep Jesse in the show. The character and Paul's performance have received acclaim from critics and fans. Critics especially praised Jesse's character development from an unsympathetic drug dealer to the moral compass of the show as he becomes increasingly guilty and remorseful for his and Walter White's actions while involved in the drug trade.

                Gustavo 'Gus' Fring is a fictional character from the television series Breaking Bad and its prequel Better Call Saul, portrayed by Giancarlo Esposito.<hr> A Chilean-American, Fring is a major methamphetamine distributor in the Southwestern United States who uses several legitimate businesses, including a chain of successful fast food fried chicken restaurants called Los Pollos Hermanos (The Chicken Brothers) and an industrial laundry facility called Lavanderia Brillante, as fronts for a vast drug operation.<hr> Fring maintains a positive public image; he is a booster for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), befriending the special agent in charge and making large donations to the Albuquerque office's civic and charitable events.<hr> However, underneath this front Gus is ruthless, cruel and Machiavellian in managing his vast drug empire.
